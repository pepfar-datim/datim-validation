\title{Break a string into labelled tokens based upon a set of patterns}
\usage{
lex(text, regexes, verbose = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{a single character string}

\item{regexes}{a named vector of regex strings.  Each string represents
a regex to match a token, and the name of the string is the
label for the token.  Each regex can contain an explicit
captured group using the standard \code{()} brackets. If a regex
doesn't not define a captured group then the entire regex will
be captured. The regexes
will be processed in order such that an early match takes
 precedence over any later match.}

\item{verbose}{print more information about the matching process. default: FALSE}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to \code{stringi::stri_match_all()}.
e.g. \code{multiline = TRUE}}
}
\value{
a named character vector with the names representing the token type
        with the value being the element extracted by the corresponding
        regular expression.
