#' Generate R documentation from inline comments.
#'
#' Roxygen2 allows you to write documentation in comment blocks co-located
#' with code.

#' The only function you're likely to need from \pkg{roxygen2} is
#' \code{\link{roxygenize}}. Otherwise refer to the vignettes to see
#' how to format the documentation.
